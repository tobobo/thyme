If your implementing something you consider to be a \"Result\" you can inherit from it and enjoy nice reliable type detection via `instanceof`. This would normally be too limited but in the case of Result implementations should be fine. Its probably a bad idea anyway though since module systems like npm can easily duplicate modules but fuck it lets see if it works with better package managers.\n\n## Installation\n\n  This form of type checking relies on identity. That means every module that dependends on it must load the exact same path.\n\n_With [component](//github.com/component/component)_  \n\n\t$ component install jkroso/result-type\n\n_With [packin](//github.com/jkroso/packin)_  \n\n\t$ packin install result-type:http://github.com/jkroso/result-type/tarball/1.0.0\n\n_With [npm](//github.com/isaacs/npm)_  \n\n\t$ echo \"good luck\" && npm install result-type\n\nthen in your app:\n\n```js\ninherit(MyResultClass, require('result-type'))\n```\n",
